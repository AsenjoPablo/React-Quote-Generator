# About this project

## What is it?

This project is a random quote generator made using React + Bootstrap 4. It takes quotes them from a .json file provided in the files.

- If you click the *Twitter button*, you can publish that quote you liked so much directly on your Twitter page. It will take both the quote and the author.
- If you click the *Get Quote button*, you will get a new quote from the .json file. It will also change the background, font color and some decoration randomly. Colors come from a preset array, and its value is randomised.
